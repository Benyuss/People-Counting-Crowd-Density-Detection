**Project Updates:**

-**31/7/19 :Pooja:** Completed implementation of a people counter to be used at doors of exhibitions/public events to count the net number of  visitors, inflow and outflow of people from a specific event. Can be used to determine the most popular choice of events/performances/talks at concerts/festivals where multiple events happen simultaneously. This implementation uses OpenCV, dlib and MobileNet SSD. Output rate:34 FPS

Tutorial followed: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/13/opencv-people-counter/

You can see how the output looks here:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xB9FA0hkU-ns3o5Zs4uCwAwZOY8uCWvA/view

If you are using the code download from the tutorial link, please note the change at line 160 to prevent Boost Error, concerning type mismatch. (See comments beneath the tutorial)(people_counter.py in this repo has the edited code)
